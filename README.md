### 🏢 Currently

I’m currently wearing multiple hats as a Full-Stack Developer, DevOps Engineer, Designer, and Manager at a startup.  
We’re building a productivity and habit tracker application focused on helping people form better routines, optimize their daily workflows, and achieve sustainable personal growth.  
My responsibilities span end-to-end product development, from architecture and user experience to deployment and team coordination.
